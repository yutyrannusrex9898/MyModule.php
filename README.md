# MyModule.php
Adds a tab to the side menu bar that will save your data in your local database in a table called ps_mymodule, however any name can be changed.

Made during my first job at courtsmammouth as a training thing to get the hang of prestashop modules and stuff lol.
I also didnt really know php very well at the time of making this so syntax can be weird here and there but it works.
